    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Sun, May 26 10:00am 90 min Fire + Water</h2>

<p>The room was warm, but not hot. I noticed that everyone seemed very focused, almost serious. Having a chance to see how so many different bodies do this practice was good for me as it relates to my practice and to understanding how other people&rsquo;s bodies work into the poses. There were a lot of interesting &lsquo;trends&rsquo;, or similarities in many of the bodies. Here are some of the things I noticed.</p>

<ul>
<li>Many people, women in particular, actually push their chest&rsquo;s forward and almsost lean their upper body over their toes.</li>
<li>Twisting in the hips to compensate for a lack of thoracic flexibility is probably the most common &lsquo;cheat&rsquo;</li>
<li>Almost noone succeeds at having front thigh parallel in Trikonasana ( Bikram style ).</li>
<li>Tuladandasana seemed to be the pose that was troublesome for the most people. There were all sorts of adjustments by people that kept them out of the pose &lsquo;properly&rsquo;. I saw lots of chests up, hips rotated up, eyes at the mirror/eyes on fingers/eyes on floor. It was the posture with the least consistency amongst the group.</li>
<li>Floor bow also seemed to pose difficulties for many folks. I saw only a few practioners who got belly on the floor and lifted up from thighs.</li>
<li>Men sweat a lot more than women.</li>
<li>Ardha Shalabasana seems to be the most challenging floor pose. I saw few people with arms under body, and only one practictioner over 25-30degrees of leg lift.</li>
</ul>


<p>As I watched everyone else I noted a strong desire to video myself and see how I look. It doesn&rsquo;t come from an egoistic place so much as a curious place to see which of the patterns I noted that I also fall into. How many of the times that others cheated their hips forward to compensate for shoulders apply to me?</p>

<p>The other thing I noticed was that people give up at about 3 or 2 when you count down a posture. It&rsquo;s as if they&rsquo;ve given themselves permission to exit before 1 because the teacher is counting. It was a very intersting revelation.</p>

<p>Lastly, I found my urge to make adjustments nearly impossible to suppress. There were so many times I wanted to pop over and remind a practicioner of their hips, to tip a shoulder more up, to adjust toes, hands, or fingers on the floor. This experience definitely made me want to practice and teach more, and I can&rsquo;t wait to observe/assist again!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my first go at markdown, octopress, AND yoga teaching. A lot of firsts in this blog post.</p>

<!-- more -->


<blockquote><p>Bring your feet together, toes and heels touch. Firm your legs from your ankles to your hips. Firm your lower belly, pulling it up and in. Keep this sensation the same for the full breathing sequence.</p></blockquote>

<!-- -->


<blockquote><p>Good, now interlace your fingers of both hands, cross your thumbs. Place your knuckles below your chin, thumbs touch the throat. Maintain contact between fingers and chin for the full ten breaths. Let’s begin.</p></blockquote>

<!-- -->


<blockquote><p>Inhale deeply through the nose. Lift the elbows out and and up to frame the face. Shoulders relaxed, belly firm and pull toward the spine.
Exhale, open your mouth wide. Press the head back with the hands, elbows drawing an arc at shoulder height as you bring them to touchExhale, open your mouth wide. Press the head back with the hands, elbows drawing an arc at shoulder height as you bring them to touch.</p></blockquote>

<!-- -->


<blockquote><p>Inhale. Head down as you bring your elbows out and up. Try to feel the breath at the back of your throat. This will help make the beautiful oceanic sound we&rsquo;re looking for.
Exhale. Stretch your mouth wide, throat constricted try to feel the heat of breath escaping your lungs. Like the fire from the belly of a dragon.</p></blockquote>

<!-- -->


<blockquote><p>Inhale. 1 2 Firm legs, strong belly. 3, 4, Draw the chest taller, 6. Pause.
Exhale, head back. 6 5 4 look back, chest high, 3 2 1.</p></blockquote>

<!-- -->


<blockquote><p>Inhale, smooth and even. Do your best to inhale the full six counts with every breath. Expand your ribs, chest, and let the lungs stretch.
Exhale, release the breath fully. Don&rsquo;t whoosh, make this exhale as even as your inhale, a full six seconds. Elbows touch just as you press out the last puffs of air.</p></blockquote>

<!-- -->


<blockquote><p>Inhale, our goal is to drop our head down and move our elbows up at exactly the same time. Smooth, even over the full six counts.
Exhale, as we press our hands firmly into our chin we work to bring the elbows forward to touch without dropping below the shoulders. Again, take the full six counts, lungs empty, bully squeezing, elbows touch.</p></blockquote>

<!-- -->


<blockquote><p>Inhale, 1 2 3 legs firm, 4 5 shoulder&rsquo;s relaxed. 6
Exhale, 6 stretch the mouth, 5 4 huge oceanic wave sound 3 2 elbows touch 1.</p></blockquote>

<!-- -->


<blockquote><p>Inhale, keep the legs firm, weight in the heels. Solid. Belly firm and up, arms up shoulder&rsquo;s relaxed.
Exhale, the only parts of our body that change are the arms, belly, and head. Legs remain firm, belly pulls up and in, arms squeeze.</p></blockquote>

<!-- -->


<blockquote><p>Inhale, these deep full body breaths expand the lung tissue, connect our mind to our body, and assist to warm up and aclimate the body to the heat.
Exhale, keeping the large muscles of our legs and belly held firm during the poses builds up carbon dioxide in our bodies. These extended exhales helps us to alleviate that excess CO2 so our muscles can continue to work.</p></blockquote>

<!-- -->


<blockquote><p>Last two breaths, Inhale. Let&rsquo;s make these the fullest breaths so far. Drive the weight back into the heels, pull up through every muscle in the legs, arms way up.
Exhale, really stretch the mouth wide. Big oceanic exhale as we use the abdominal muscles pulling in and up to press out all our air. Elbows high, eyes back.</p></blockquote>

<!-- -->


<blockquote><p>Inhale, full 5 counts, 1, belly in, 2, eyes focused, 3, get taller, 4, 5, 6.
Last Exhale, 6 press head back, 5, arms move smooth, 4, eyes back, 3, belly up and in, 2, 1. CLAP Change.</p></blockquote>

<!-- -->


<blockquote><p>Slowly bring your body back to neutral, weight firm over your heels, eyes on your own eyes in the mirror. Try to keep your breath cadence nice and even. Resist the urge to twitch, or fidget. Let the shoulders relax, heart slightly up, bum and tail pulling slightly down.</p>

<p>Let’s get ready for our second set. Hands interlaced, up to your chins. Here we go, let’s make this one even more beautiful.</p></blockquote>
