##Sun, May 26 10:00am 90 min Fire + Water ##

The room was warm, but not hot. I noticed that everyone seemed very focused, almost serious. Having a chance to see how so many different bodies do this practice was good for me as it relates to my practice and to understanding how other people's bodies work into the poses. There were a lot of interesting 'trends', or similarities in many of the bodies. Here are some of the things I noticed.

* Many people, women in particular, actually push their chest's forward and almsost lean their upper body over their toes.
* Twisting in the hips to compensate for a lack of thoracic flexibility is probably the most common 'cheat'
* Almost noone succeeds at having front thigh parallel in Trikonasana ( Bikram style ).
* Tuladandasana seemed to be the pose that was troublesome for the most people. There were all sorts of adjustments by people that kept them out of the pose 'properly'. I saw lots of chests up, hips rotated up, eyes at the mirror/eyes on fingers/eyes on floor. It was the posture with the least consistency amongst the group.
* Floor bow also seemed to pose difficulties for many folks. I saw only a few practioners who got belly on the floor and lifted up from thighs.
* Men sweat a lot more than women.
* Ardha Shalabasana seems to be the most challenging floor pose. I saw few people with arms under body, and only one practictioner over 25-30degrees of leg lift.

As I watched everyone else I noted a strong desire to video myself and see how I look. It doesn't come from an egoistic place so much as a curious place to see which of the patterns I noted that I also fall into. How many of the times that others cheated their hips forward to compensate for shoulders apply to me? 

The other thing I noticed was that people give up at about 3 or 2 when you count down a posture. It's as if they've given themselves permission to exit before 1 because the teacher is counting. It was a very intersting revelation. 

Lastly, I found my urge to make adjustments nearly impossible to suppress. There were so many times I wanted to pop over and remind a practicioner of their hips, to tip a shoulder more up, to adjust toes, hands, or fingers on the floor. This experience definitely made me want to practice and teach more, and I can't wait to observe/assist again!
