It didn't take long before I realized that my dialogue was much too wordy. Also, it didn't carry much flow. I've worked through and thought long and hard about how to tackle this section, and I came up with a three part strategy:
<!-- more -->
### My Strategy
1. Write my prose first. This is V1 the wordy dialogue.
2. Create a 'tactic' for how I'll divide up the breaths. Make a note card of this as a tool.
3. Read it and time it, note differences, reduce words to fit.
4. Polish and practice.

So now I'm on v2, I've yet to get any feedback from the TTTeachers so I'm excited to do that. If any of you have any feedback after reading it, would love to hear it.

## Pranayama Deep Breathing ##
> **Inhale** in through the nose. Elbows out and up to frame the face.
>
> **Exhale**. Press the head back with the hands, bring elbows together to touch in front.
<!-- -->
> **Inhale**. Feel the breath in the back of the throat. It should sound like a wheeze or a snore. Loud enough for everyone to hear.
>
> **Exhale**. Wide open mouth, H.A. 'Haaaa' sound. Like ocean waves in the distance ( or fogging a mirror )
<!-- -->
> **Inhale** 1 2 3 4 5 6
>
> **Exhale** 6 5 4 3 2 1
<!-- -->
> **Inhale** Take the full six counts to fill the lungs. If you get full before six, hold your breath, we'll catch up. 
>
> **Exhale** Smoothly. Don't whoosh all your air out at the beginning. Even breathing all six.
<!-- -->
> **Inhale** Arms and head move in unison. Chin down, arms up, shoulders relaxed.
>
> **Exhale** As elbows come down, draw a semicirle in front of the body. Elbows stay up above shoulders.
<!-- -->
> **Inhale** 1 2 3 4 5 6
>
> **Exhale** 6 5 4 3 2 1
<!-- -->
> **Inhale** Keep your belly firm. Check your legs, pull up on anything that has relaxed.
>
> **Exhale** Keep heels pressed into floor. Lift up chest, push all the air out with the abs.
<!-- -->
> **Inhale** This deep breathing connects your body and mind, acclimates us, and warms the body for our practice.
>
> **Exhale** These long exhales balance the CO2 and oxygen in the body, allowing or muscles to keep working for us.
<!-- -->
> **Inhale** Last two, make these the fullest yet. Open the chest, breath in.
>
> **Exhale** See if you can press out all the air and feel your elbows squeeze at the very last moment.
<!-- -->
> **Inhale** Last breath 1 2 3 4 5 6
>
> **Exhale** 6 5 empty your lungs 3 2 sqeeze belly. 
<!-- -->
> **Relax**
